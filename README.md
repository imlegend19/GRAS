# GRAS (Git Repositories Archiving Service)

Git Repository Mining Service (GRAS) is a tool designed to thoroughly mine software repositories. Software repository data has become the foundation of many empirical software engineering research projects such as sentiment mining, developer social networks, etc. However, the mining and collection of this data proves to be very challenging due to the density and connectedness of each component. GRAS was built due to the need for cleaner and coherent organization of mined data and optimization of the mining process. It is capable of mining a repository from various version control systems and storing it into more than 3 types of databases in a harmonized way. GRAS also has a built-in file dependency analyzer (currently, Java & Python are only supported) that parses the entire project and creates a heterogenous graph representing the file relationships and their dependencies on each other. The file dependency graph is stored in a Neo4j database. We are currently working on the Identity Merging Component.
